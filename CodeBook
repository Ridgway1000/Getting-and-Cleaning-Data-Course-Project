Run_Analysis.R - This is the R Script that performs the 5 steps outlined in the course project instructions.

Note - I pre-downloaded the data and set the working directory into the same folder as the required data on my local drive. This could have been included as an instruction within the 
script if i had not already saved it locally.

- Data was downloaded from "https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip"
    

#### I read the data into dataframes and assigned them to the below variables:

features <- reads in the features.txt file
activity_labels <- reads in the activities.txt file

#### test data

subject_test <- reads in the subject_test.txt file
functions_test <- reads in the X_test.txt file 
code_test <- reads in the Y_test.txt file 

#### train data

subject_train <- reads in the subject_train.txt file
functions_train <- reads in the X_train.txt file
code_train <- reads in the y_train.txt file

#### I merged the test and train files into 1 file based on the functions, subject and code columns.

functions_bind <- a rowbind (rbind) on the functions column
code_bind <- a rowbind (rbind) on the code column
subject <- a rowbind (rbind) on the subject column
combined_data <- a column bind (cbind) on all 3 combined columns above.



#### I extrtacted only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement into a variable named tidy_data

tidy_data <- subsets ther variable created above - combined_data and selects onlt the subject and code columns with the mean and standard deviation (std) for each measurement


#### Use descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set.

tidy_data$code <- I replaced the code names and replaced with corresponding activity taken from second column of the activity_labels variable defined initirially.


#### Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names

- code column in tidy_data renamed into activity
- All Acc in column’s name replaced by Accelerometer
- All Gyro in column’s name replaced by Gyroscope
- All BodyBody in column’s name replaced by Body
- All Mag in column’s name replaced by Magnitude
- All start with character f in column’s name replaced by Frequency
- All start with character t in column’s name replaced by Time


#### Group the tidied data into a final variable to list the average for each variable grouped by each activity and each subject.

final_average_data is created by sumarizing the tidy_data variable by mean and then grouping by the acticity and suject variables.
